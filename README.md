# Html-e2e
Library to run e2e tests against html writing them interface-agnostic. For example instead of calling the "click()" method on a "save" button we can call "do('save')" and it will look for buttons or links that can be clicked and contain the text "save".

## Getting started
Check the integration tests for examples of usage

## Run all tests
