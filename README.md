# Html-e2e
Library to run e2e tests against html written agnostic of the specific interface. For example instead of calling "click()" method over a "save" button we can call "do('save')" and it will look for buttons or links that can be clicked and contain the text "save".

## Getting started
1. Check the integration tests for examples of usage
