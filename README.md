# Html-e2e
Library to run e2e tests against html written agnostic of the specific interface, for instance instead of calling the click method over a button we can call the "do" method and the parameter is the text of the button. In this case the application is going to look for buttons or links that can be clicked and contain that text.

## Getting started
